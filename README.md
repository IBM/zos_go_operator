**Open Enterprise SDK for Go Operator collection**
========================

The **IBM® Open Enterprise SDK for Go Operator collection** provides automation for installing the Go language on one or more z/OS endpoints and managing its lifecycle in a hybrid Cloud environment. The Go operator makes use of the **z/OS Package Manager** to install the software on to z/OS and manage its lifecycle.


Import this collection into an instance of **z/OS Cloud Broker** running in RedHat OpenShift Container Platform to get started quickly. **z/OS Cloud Broker** generates a Kubernetes operator, making it easy to deploy Go to a z/OS endpoint. For information, see the [documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/SSV97FN_latest/zstack/go.html).
